<p>
This tool lets you select document objects by using the mouse, with a single click or by area (rectangle, circle or polygon). For selections by polygon, the angle constraint can be activated using the &quot;Shift&quot; key.<br>

If at the end of a selection, the &quot;Shift&quot; key is held down, the selection is added to the existing selection. Objects belonging to the initial selection and to the new selection are deselected.<br>

If the &quot;Shift&quot; key is not held down, the selection is replaced.<br> Double-click to open the <a href="pg1_601.html">card</a> on the selection.<br>

Objects represented by unselectable styles cannot be selected (see <a href="pg1_604.html">Presentation Box</a>).

The popup lets you choose the type of selection by area:<br>
<b>Selection by Rectangle</b>: click and drag.<br>
<b>Selection by Circle</b>: click and drag.<br>
<b>Selection by Polygon</b>: a succession of clicks, then &quot;Enter&quot; or double-click to validate the selection.<br> If you chose the selection by polygon, selection by pointing is disabled. To enable selection by pointing, choose one of the other modes.

<p>
4 options are available: <b>Select All Objects</b>: if several objects of the same type are superimposed, only the first object is selected if this option is disabled. Otherwise, all objects are selected.<br>
<b>Select All Types</b>: if several objects of different types are superimposed, only the objects of the first type (the one most recently displayed in the presentation box) are selected if this option is disabled. Otherwise, all objects are selected.<br>

<b>Objects Completely Included</b>: when selecting by zone, do not include objects whose segmentation points are included in the selected area.<br>
<b>Use Angle Constraint</b>: when selecting by polygon, it lets you enable angle constraint for the desired value (expressed in degrees).<br>
<br>

The two lists presented in the &quot;Selection By Pointing&quot; and &quot;Selection By Area&quot; sections let you filter the types that can be selected in these two modes. These filters are added to the pre-existing filtering in the presentation box.
