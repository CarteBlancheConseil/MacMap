<p>
The Univariate Analysis XMap tool lets you view statistical series as histograms and lets you create classifications. It operates on a selection of objects of the same type. The information is represented on different sheets.<br>
<b>Spreadsheet</b>
<br> When the window is opened, a spreadsheet that is identical to that of the <a href="pg1_602.html">Spreadsheet XMap</a> tool is generated. Its use is similar; the only difference is that the values can not be edited.<br> To create an analysis, you must first select one of the columns in the spreadsheet and then click on the &quot;Calculate&quot; button. Three new sheets are then added:<br>
<b>Indicators</b>
<br> This sheet presents the main characteristics of the selected series.  The selected rows and columns can be exported in a tabulated text, CSV or DBF file.<br>
<b>Histogram</b>
<br> This sheet shows the histogram that corresponds to the statistical series. It has a menu that lets you access the following functions:<br> - Publish: This function exports the histogram in PDF format.<br> - Select All: This function lets you select the objects that constitute the histogram.<br> - Group Field: This function lets you specify a field that will contain the index of classes. This field is then usable to create choropleth views.<br> - Discretize: This function lets you create classifications using automatic methods shown in a dialog box.<br> - Delete Partition: This function lets you delete the current classification. The objects are reset to 0.<br> - Presentation: Lets you select the colors for the values below and above the mean, and the class separators.<br> The classes are shown by separators. To delete a separator, simply double-click on its base. To add a separator, double-click below the base of the abscissas.<br>
<b>Distribution Diagram</b>
<br> This sheet shows the total number of different classes as a diagram. At the start, the diagram is empty since there is no classification. It has a menu that lets you access the following functions:<br> - Publish: export the diagram in PDF format.<br> - Presentation: select the diagram color.<br>
