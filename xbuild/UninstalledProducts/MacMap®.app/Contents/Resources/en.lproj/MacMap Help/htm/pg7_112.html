The Colored Lines vDef lets you represent objects as colored lines based on the value of a field. The definition of this style consists of discretizing a statistical series and then assigning a color to each of the classes.</p>

<p>
The "Field" section lets you specify the field on which the view will be based. This field must contain numeric values.<br>
The "Discretization" section lets you select an automatic method for defining classes.<br>
The "Number of Classes" section lets you specify the number of classes desired.<br>
The "Min calculation" popup lets you calculate automatically the lower limit for the representation of objects (based on type, selection or contrasts). This value corresponds to the smallest value of the field that you wish to represent.<br>
The "Max calculation" popup lets you calculate automatically the upper limit for the representation of objects (based on type, selection or contrasts). This value corresponds to the largest value of the field that you wish to represent.<br>
The "Discretize" button lets you calculate the limits for classes, based on the specified settings. This calculation can be done based on type, selection or contrasts. The result is displayed in the list and can be modified manually if necessary (by clicking on a value in the list).<br>
The "+" and "-" buttons let you manually add or delete classes.

The "Colorimetry" section lets you select the colors to apply to each of the classes. These colors are automatically calculated based on the reference colors.<br>
The "Class color" section lets you individually select (by class) a representation in color or in continuous gradient. The last section ("Absent") lets you not represent a class.<br>
The associated well let you edit the color of the class. In the case of a continuous gradient, you specify a starting color and an arrival color.

The items in this section apply to all classes defined by the discretization.<br>
The "Width" section lets you set the width of lines.<br>
The "Offset" section lets you offset the line (to the right for a positive value and to the left for a negative value).<br>
The "Miter Limit" section lets you set the limit at which joins are beveled.<br>
The "Cap" section lets you select the type of line ending (butt, round or projecting).<br>
The "Join" section lets you select the representation type for each of the joins of the segmentation (miter, rounded or bevel).<br>
The "Dash" section lets you select a dash style.<br>
The "Smoothing" section lets you smooth the segmentation (remove angularities).

The "Scale of Reference" field lets you obtain a view proportional to the scale. Each of the sizes indicated will be recalculated when displayed according to the current scale and reference scale. Setting this field to a value of "Fixed Size" results in an unchanged display regardless of the current scale.<br>
The "Unit" field lets you select between various measurements (size, thickness, ...) in pixels or in millimeters.<br>
The "Reverse Display" field lets you reverse the order in which classes are displayed.<br>
The "CMYK" field lets you set the type of color you want: CMYK or RGB.</p>

<p>
This option lets you define display conditions for each object. A display condition is made up of three elements:<br>
- A field in the attribute table,<br>
- An operator,<br>
- A value.<br>
An object not meeting the defined condition will not be displayed by the style, without having to hide it.

This option lets you select two x and y fields which modify the location of the display without modifying the object geometry. These fields can be filled in using the <a href="pg2_301.html">Offset</a> tool.
