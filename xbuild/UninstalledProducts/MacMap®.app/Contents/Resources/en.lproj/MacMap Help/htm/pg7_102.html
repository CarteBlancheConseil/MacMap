<p>
The View Orientation vDef lets you represent line or area objects with an arrow. If the "Direction" field of the object is 1, the arrow will be located at the end of the segmentation. If the "Direction" field is set to -1, the arrow will be located at the start of the segmentation, in the reverse direction. If the "Direction" field is set to 0, the object will not be represented. By default, the style is based on the modes of the "Subtype" field.

The "Class Field" field lets you specify the information that the style must represent. Only numerical fields which have entry constraints can be used.<br>
<b>If you change the class field of an existing style, the display settings of each of the modes are reset.</b>
<br> The "Scale of Reference" field lets you obtain a proportional view. Each of the sizes indicated will be recalculated when displayed according to the current scale and reference scale. Setting this field to a value of "Fixed Size" results in an unchanged display regardless of the current scale.<br> The "Unit" field lets you select between various measurements (size, thickness, ...) in pixels or in millimeters.<br> The "Reverse Display" field lets you reverse the order in which classes are displayed.<br> The "CMYK" field lets you set the type of color you want: CMYK or RGB.
