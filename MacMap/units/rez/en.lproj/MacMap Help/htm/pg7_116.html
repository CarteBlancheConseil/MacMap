<p>
The Circular Diagram vDef allows you to represent data in the form of a sector (or "Pie"). It is also possible to define circle size proportionally to a field.<br>
The pop-up, the list and the "+" and "-" buttons in the top, right-hand corner of the window, allow you to select fields to be included in the view.<br>
</p>

<td class="item2">
Appearance
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
The elements located in this "Appearance" section allow you to define the appearance (Circle Size, Sector Color, Opacity) of each sector. The characteristics defined here are applied to the field selected in the list of style fields.<br>
</p>

Outline

<tr>
<td>
<p>
This section allows you to determine circle clipping (thickness and color).  It is not therefore applied to a particular field.<br>
The "Minimum radius" section lets you specify the minimum size of the circles. The "Maximum radius" gives an indication of maximum circle size when you choose to calculate circle size proportionally to a field.

Proportionality
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
The "Field" section lets you specify the field on which the view will be based. This field must contain numeric values.<br>
The "Proportionality" section lets you specify the proportionality type that you wish to obtain. With A=Q, you calculate the area of circles relative to quantity. For A=Q2/3, you calculate the area of circles relative to the quantity raised to the power of 2/3.<br>
The "Minimum Value" section lets you set the lower limit for the representation of objects. This value corresponds to the smallest value of the field that you wish to represent. The "&lt;" button lets you calculate this value automatically (based on type, selection or contrasts).<br>
The "Maximum Value" section lets you set the upper limit for the representation of objects. This value corresponds to the largest value of the field that you wish to represent. The associated "&gt;" button allows you to calculate this value automatically (based on type, selection or contrasts).

The "Scale of Reference" field lets you set the proportionality based on the scale. Each of the sizes indicated is recalculated when displayed according to the current scale and reference scale.<br>
The "Unit" field lets you select between various measurements (size, thickness, ...) in pixels or in millimeters.<br>
The "CMYK" field lets you set the type of color you want: CMYK or RGB.

<tr>
<td>
<p>
This option lets you define display conditions for each object. A display condition is made up of three elements:<br>
- A field in the attribute table,<br>
- An operator,<br>
- A value.<br>
An object not meeting the defined condition will not be displayed by the style, without having to hide it.

<p>
This option lets you select two x and y fields which modify the location of the display without modifying the object geometry. These fields can be filled in using the <a href="pg2_301.html">Offset</a> tool.
