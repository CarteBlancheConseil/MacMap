The cleanup options let you define the settings for the <a href="pg3_302.html">Clean</a> function. The &quot;Clean&quot; function lets you make automatic corrections to a network in order to make it topological. These settings are divided into 5 sections:
</p>
<p>
<b>Types involved in cleanup</b>:<br> &quot;Nodes&quot; are points marking each intersection, while &quot;edges&quot; are lines composed of a point at each end.
</p>
<p>
<b>Intersection Creation</b>:<br> Crossroads are intersections or ends of the network. Pre-existing crossroads are taken into account. If some intersections do not include crossroads, they will be created in the type and subtype and with the defined name.
</p>
<p>
<b>Intervention Distances</b>:<br> Intervention distances to crossroads let you specify the limit from which two points belong to the same intersection. Intervention distances to bridges let you specify the limit from which two points belonging to the same intersection should not be considered as a crossroad. This option lets you, for example, avoid automatic splitting of crossing segments if their intersection is found in the intervention radius of a bridge.
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Bridge Definition</b>:<br> This section lets you specify in which type and subtype the cleanup must search for bridges. The bridges must be pre-existing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Automatic Cleanup</b>:<br> Enabling automatic cleanup lets you run the cleanup procedure each time you create or edit an object belonging to the network (node or edge). This function must be used with care since any edits are automatic. It also uses a lot of processor time.
