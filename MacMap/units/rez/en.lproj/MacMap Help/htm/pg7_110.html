<p>
The Proportional Rectangles vDef lets you represent objects as squares proportional to the value of a field, located at the centroid of objects (if no coordinate is specified in the vDef options). The proportionality is calculated based on the area. Objects are displayed in order of decreasing value.</p>

<p>
The "Field" section lets you specify the field on which the view will be based. This field must contain numeric values.<br>
The "Proportionality" section lets you specify the proportionality type that you wish to obtain. With A=Q, you calculate the area of rectangles relative to quantity. For A=Q2/3, you calculate the area of rectangles relative to the quantity raised to the power of 2/3.<br>
The "Min calculation" popup lets you calculate automatically the lower limit for the representation of objects (based on type, selection or contrasts). This value corresponds to the smallest value of the field that you wish to represent.<br>
The "Max calculation" popup lets you calculate automatically the upper limit for the representation of objects (based on type, selection or contrasts). This value corresponds to the largest value of the field that you wish to represent.<br>
The "Exceeding Maximum" section lets you either not display objects whose value is greater than the maximum, or represent these objects with a transparent interior.

The "Minimum size" field lets you set the size of rectangles corresponding to the specified minimum value. In the "Maximum size" field, you obtain the size of rectangles corresponding to the specified maximum value.<br>
The "Thickness" field lets you define the size of the clipping.<br>
The "Color" field lets you specify the color of the clipping.<br>
The "Interior" field lets you select a color, a <a href="pg7_202.html">pattern</a> or a gradient for the interior of rectangles. Selecting a gradient lets you color rectangles based on another field. Clicking on the color enables the Gradient panel, which lets you define a substyle.<br>
The "Opacity" field lets you adjust the transparency of the interior of rectangles.

The "Number of Classes" section lets you specify the number of classes desired.<br>
The "Min calculation" popup lets you calculate automatically the lower limit for the representation of objects (based on type, selection or contrasts). This value corresponds to the smallest value of the field that you wish to represent.<br>
The "Max calculation" popup lets you calculate automatically the upper limit for the representation of objects (based on type, selection or contrasts). This value corresponds to the largest value of the field that you wish to represent.<br>
The "Discretize" button lets you calculate the limits for classes, based on the specified settings. This calculation can be done based on type, selection or contrasts. The result is displayed in the list and can be modified manually if necessary (by clicking on a value in the list).<br>
You can add or remove classes by using the "+" and "-" buttons.<br>
The "Colorimetry" section lets you select the colors to apply to each of the classes. These colors are automatically calculated based on the reference colors.<br>
The "Interior" section lets you individually select (by class) a representation in color or <a href="pg7_202.html">pattern</a>. The associated wells let you edit the color of the class or the pattern.
